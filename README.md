# UCSBRMP Effect of Inversion Asymmetry on Quantum Confinement of Dirac Semimtal Cd3As2
In this project, I studied the effects of inversion asymmetry on the electronic transport of the quantum system. I modeled the Dirac Hamiltonian equation of the system and then created simulations by changing the values of inversion asymmetry and hybridization. 
I created a Landau Level detector where the user can input experimental data and the output helps instantly detect the Landau levels of the system.
I also created a program that calculates the spectral density of a system
